This guide covers the best breweries near North Woodstock, helping you plan brewery visits that become highlights of your vacation.

## The Craft Beer Revolution in North Woodstock

North Woodstock's craft brewery scene reflects broader trends in New Hampshire, where small breweries have become community gathering spaces. Beyond just beer, these establishments create gathering places where locals and visitors mingle, live music happens, and community forms.

The proximity of North Woodstock to Loon Mountain and Franconia Notch has also made it attractive to outdoor enthusiasts who appreciate the après-adventure ritual of relaxing with quality beer. Many brewery patrons arrive directly from hiking, mountaineering, or other outdoor activities, making breweries natural social hubs.

## Woodstock Inn Brewery

Woodstock Inn Brewery, located right in downtown North Woodstock, is the closest brewery to Inn 32. This establishment combines a full-service restaurant with an onsite brewery, making it perfect for combining food and beer in one visit.

### The Experience

**Atmosphere** - Woodstock Inn Brewery features a warm, welcoming interior that works for everything from casual beer drinkers to fine dining. The restaurant side maintains refined atmosphere while the bar side is casual and friendly. You can dress up or come in hiking clothes—both feel appropriate.

**Beers** - The onsite brewery produces year-round styles ranging from accessible pilsners and IPAs to creative experimental beers. Tap lists rotate, so repeat visits offer new discoveries. Their flagship beers remain consistent, letting you revisit favorites while exploring new releases.

**Food** - Woodstock Inn Brewery serves elevated pub fare. Quality ingredients and careful preparation distinguish the food from typical brewery fare. From burgers to fish, pasta to seasonal specials, the menu offers choices for various preferences and dietary needs.

**Setting** - Windows overlook the Pemigewasset River and surrounding scenery. Evening light reflecting off the river creates beautiful ambiance. Outdoor seating in warmer months offers direct river access.

### What to Order

Start with a flight of several beers, allowing you to sample multiple styles without over-committing to any single beer. Staff are knowledgeable and happy to make recommendations based on your preferences. If you enjoy hoppy beers, ask about their IPAs. Prefer balanced, smooth flavors? Their pale ales or pilsners might appeal.

Pair beer with food carefully. Their lighter beers work well with salads and lighter dishes. Richer beers complement beef and heavier fare. Staff can suggest pairings if you're uncertain.

### When to Visit
