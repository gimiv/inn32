# Local Pints: A Guide to Woodstock’s Craft Breweries

September in the White Mountains hits the sweet spot. The massive summer crowds begin to thin out, the oppressive humidity breaks, and the air turns crisp in the evenings—a subtle hint that autumn is just around the corner. After a perfect, mild day of hiking on the Appalachian Trail or cruising the Kancamagus Highway, there is exactly one way to celebrate: tracking down a cold, locally poured craft beer.

New Hampshire has quietly cultivated one of the most vibrant craft brewing scenes in New England, and North Woodstock happens to sit right in the heart of the action. At Inn 32, we frequently host groups traversing the "NH Beer Trail," and we’ve spent plenty of time "researching" the local offerings to curate this guide to the absolute best pints in town.

## The Cornerstone: Woodstock Inn Brewery

When you talk about craft beer in the White Mountains, you are talking about the Woodstock Inn Brewery. Located quite literally walking distance down the street from Inn 32, this sprawling operation is a beloved statewide institution and a pioneer of the New Hampshire craft scene.

What started decades ago as a tiny brew-pub has evolved into a massive, multi-faceted complex. The sheer scale is impressive, featuring multiple dining rooms, a massive four-season patio, and bustling bars featuring dozens of their house-brewed drafts.

### What to Drink
Woodstock Inn shines when it comes to classic, highly drinkable ales. 
*   **Pig's Ear Brown Ale:** This is their flagship beer. It’s a beautifully balanced, malty English-style brown ale that pairs perfectly with the onset of crisp fall weather. 
*   **4000 Footer IPA:** Named as a tribute to the 48 massive peaks in New Hampshire, this is a clean, classic West Coast-style IPA with a bitter bite. (Don't confuse it with the newer, hazy New England IPAs.)
*   **Autumn Ale:** If you are visiting in late September, this seasonal release is mandatory. It’s packed with cinnamon, nutmeg, and real pumpkin.

## The Rising Star: Schilling Beer Co.

If you are willing to take a scenic 25-minute drive north through Franconia Notch, an incredibly unique destination awaits in the small town of Littleton: Schilling Beer Co.

Situated in a stunningly restored 18th-century grist mill perched directly over the turbulent Ammonoosuc River, Schilling offers what is arguably the most picturesque taproom in the state. However, the view is only half the draw. Unlike most modern American breweries that chase the latest hazy IPA trend, Schilling focuses obsessively on traditional European styles.

### What to Drink
Schilling specializes in crisp, clean, lower-ABV lagers and complex Belgian ales that are notoriously difficult to brew perfectly. 
*   **Alexandr:** A perfectly executed, authentic Czech-style Pilsner. It is bright, slightly bitter, incredibly refreshing, and served with a beautiful, thick head of foam.
*   **Popper:** A complex, spicy, and effervescent Belgian-style pale ale that showcases their mastery of historic yeast strains. 
*   **The Pizza:** Don't leave without ordering a wood-fired pizza straight from their imported Italian oven. The blistered Neapolitan crust is legendary.

## A Hidden Gem down South: Twin Barns Brewing

If you’re traveling up to Inn 32 from the south via I-93, we highly recommend making a pit stop in Meredith to grab lunch at Twin Barns Brewing. 

Just an hour south of North Woodstock, near the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee, Twin Barns occupies... well, two massive antique barns. The completely renovated, soaring timber-framed space feels both historic and incredibly modern. The brewers here strike a brilliant balance between classic styles and modern techniques. 

### What to Drink
Twin Barns is the perfect place to explore modern, fruit-forward flavors heavily influenced by the contemporary New England brewing scene. 
*   **Lake Cruiser:** A remarkably smooth, hazy Double IPA boasting intense notes of mango and citrus without being overly bitter.
*   **Belknap Ale:** A nod to the local mountain range, this is a fantastic, everyday amber ale.

## Practical Details for the NH Beer Trail

To ensure a safe and enjoyable brewery tour, remember these quick basics:

*   **Pace Yourself:** While Schilling specializes in low-ABV lagers, many of the IPAs poured across the region pack a punch (often hovering around the 8% ABV mark). Drink plenty of water.
*   **Timing:** The Woodstock Inn Brewery is massive and stays open late, making it the perfect final stop of the night. Conversely, Schilling tends to get incredibly crowded by late afternoon on weekends, so aim to get there early for lunch to secure a table overlooking the river.
*   **Designated Driver:** The winding mountain roads of New Hampshire are dark and completely unforgiving at night. Always, always travel with a designated driver or rely on a local cab service. 

## Walking Distance to the Best 

The absolute best part about exploring the local craft beer scene while staying at Inn 32? You don’t have to drive at all to hit the flagship brewery.

Because we are located right on Main Street in North Woodstock, you can simply leave your keys in the room, take a leisurely five-minute stroll down the sidewalk, and enjoy a full evening of pints, live music, and incredible food at the Woodstock Inn Brewery without a second thought. When the night is over, the walk back to your quiet, comfortable bed is a breeze.
