# Winter Wonderlands: The Lincoln Ice Castles

December in the White Mountains feels like stepping directly into a snow-globe. The massive summer crowds have gone home, the ski resorts are frantically blowing snow to prepare for the season, and a completely different kind of magic begins to take shape right here in the valley. 

If you are planning a holiday getaway or a mid-winter escape to the North Woodstock and Lincoln area, there is one attraction you absolutely cannot miss: the Ice Castles. 

Located less than five minutes from Inn 32, this sprawling, seasonal installation transforms the bitter mountain cold into an unbelievable, illuminated piece of interactive art. Here is everything you need to know about experiencing the magic of the Ice Castles during your winter stay.

## A Hand-Built Frozen Fortress

What makes the Ice Castles so staggeringly impressive is the fact that the entire installation is hand-built by professional ice artisans. There are no massive concrete molds or steel underlying structures holding up the massive towers. 

The process literally begins with the artists farming tens of thousands of individual icicles. Over the course of several weeks, as the temperatures drop well below freezing, these icicles are meticulously harvested and placed one by one. They are constantly sprayed with water from specialized sprinklers, allowing the ice to slowly bind together and grow organically.

The final result is a massive, sprawling fortress of pure ice that can weigh over 20 million pounds. Because the water freezes naturally in the wind and cold, no two walls are ever exactly the same. The organic, dripping stalactites and sweeping archways look entirely like a setting pulled out of a fantasy novel. 

## Exploring the Castles

The Ice Castles are designed to be explored, not just looked at. Once you enter the massive icy archway, you are free to wander the labyrinth of frozen pathways at your own pace.

### 1. The Ice Slides
Without a doubt, the most popular feature for kids (and adventurous adults) are the ice slides. These are massive, enclosed tubes carved directly into the walls of the castle. You grab a small plastic sled, sit down at the top of the tower, and shoot through a smooth, completely clear tunnel of ice. 

### 2. The Mystic Forest Light Walk
In recent years, the Ice Castles have expanded the experience beyond just the ice walls. The Mystic Forest is an immersive, quarter-mile walking trail through the snow-covered pine forest adjacent to the castle. The path is deeply illuminated by millions of LED lights that pulse and change color synchronously with an ethereal, ambient soundtrack. It is incredibly peaceful and a fantastic way to escape the crowds in the main courtyard.

### 3. The Sleigh Rides
For the ultimate romantic or family experience, you can book a horse-drawn sleigh ride that takes you on an extended loop through the surrounding woods. Wrapping up in a thick blanket under the stars while massive draft horses pull you across the snow is the quintessential New England winter experience. 

## The Best Time to Visit

Timing your visit to the Ice Castles requires a little bit of planning.

*   **When They Open:** The opening date is entirely dependent on the weather. Mother Nature needs to drop the temperature into the low twenties consistently for weeks before the ice is thick enough to support the massive structures safely. Typically, the Castles open in mid-to-late January and remain open through early March, but you must check their website for the official opening announcement. 
*   **Day vs. Night:** Visiting during the day allows you to see the incredible, natural glacial-blue color of the thickest ice walls. However, the experience is arguably best at night. Hundreds of LED lights are frozen *inside* the ice walls, creating a glowing, constantly shifting kaleidoscope of color that lights up the entire castle from within. For the best of both worlds, book a ticket about 30 minutes before sunset!

## Essential Cold Weather Tips

*   **Footwear is Critical:** The floor of the Ice Castles is not paved; it is a bed of crushed, deeply packed snow that can become as slick as a skating rink. Leave the fashion boots at the hotel. You need heavy, insulated winter boots with serious tread. If you have slip-on microspikes, absolutely bring them.
*   **Strollers Ensure Struggle:** You cannot push a traditional stroller through the deep, crushed snow inside the castles. Instead, bring your child in a wearable carrier, or pull them behind you in a small plastic sled!
*   **Layer Up:** The castles act like a massive refrigerator, trapping the cold air inside the walls. It is frequently five to ten degrees colder inside the castle courtyard than it is in the parking lot. Wear a heavy parka, thick mittens, and a sturdy hat. 

## Thawing Out Back at Basecamp

After spending two hours exploring a literal palace of ice, the only thing you will want to do is thaw out immediately.

Because the Ice Castles are located right in Lincoln, Inn 32 serves as the absolute perfect winter basecamp. You don’t have to suffer through a long, freezing drive back to a distant rental house. Within five minutes of leaving the castles, you can be walking through the door of your warm, newly renovated room in North Woodstock. 

Turn the heater up, take a steaming hot shower in one of our newly completely redesigned, spa-like bathrooms, and recount your frozen adventure.
