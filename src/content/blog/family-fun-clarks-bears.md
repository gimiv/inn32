# Family Fun at Clark’s Bears and Lost River

August is the undisputed king of the family summer vacation. The weather is consistently warm, the days stretch long into the evening, and the kids are hungry for adventure before heading back to school. If you are bringing the whole crew to the White Mountains, establishing a home base in Lincoln or North Woodstock is the smartest move you can make. 

Why? Because two of the most iconic, family-friendly attractions in all of New England are located less than a ten-minute drive from Inn 32: Clark's Bears and the Lost River Gorge & Boulder Caves. 

In this guide, we’ve put together the perfect weekend itinerary for a family getaway that balances thrilling history, incredible natural geology, and memories that will last a lifetime.

## Day One: The Magic of Clark’s Bears

It’s impossible to talk about family fun in the White Mountains without mentioning Clark’s Bears. This legendary roadside attraction has been operating right on Route 3 since 1928. It is a brilliant mashup of history, wildlife, and old-school amusement park charm that appeals to toddlers, teenagers, and grandparents equally.

### The Bear Show
The undisputed centerpiece of the property is the famous Bear Show. The Clark family has been raising and training rescued Black Bears for decades. The show is entirely unscripted—the bears do exactly what they want, when they want—and the trainers rely on positive reinforcement to guide them through a half-hour of hilarious antics. Watching a massive 500-pound bear confidently ride a scooter or dunk a basketball is a surreal and incredibly endearing experience.

### The White Mountain Central Railroad
After the bears, make a beeline for the train station. Clark’s operates one of the last remaining wood-burning Climax steam locomotives in the world. The 25-minute train ride takes you out of the park, across a stunning covered bridge over the Pemigewasset River, and deep into the woods—where you’ll inevitably be “held up” by the infamous Wolfman. The Wolfman is a legendary, ragged character who chases the train in a wildly entertaining, theatrical interaction that kids absolutely love.

### The Rest of the Park
Beyond the main events, Clark’s is packed with quirky history and fun:

*   **Water Blaster Boats:** Perfect for cooling off in the August heat.
*   **The Americana Museum:** A massive, eclectic collection of antique steam engines, vintage fire trucks, and weird mechanical oddities from the early 1900s.
*   **Segway Park:** A self-guided, off-road Segway track for older kids and adults to test their balance.

## Day Two: Exploring Lost River Gorge

After a day of bears and trains, shift gears on Day Two and dive directly into the wild geology of the region. Lost River Gorge & Boulder Caves is located just up Route 112 from North Woodstock. It is a breathtaking natural wonder hidden deep within Kinsman Notch.

Thousands of years ago, colossal glaciers moved through the valley, carving a massive gorge and piling house-sized granite boulders on top of each other. The result is a spectacular landscape where the "Lost River" constantly disappears beneath the chaotic rock piles and re-emerges in stunning waterfalls.

### The Boardwalks and the Caves
The entire mile-long loop through the gorge is constructed of sturdy wooden boardwalks and staircases. You're walking directly over the rushing river and suspended halfway up the gorge walls. But the real draw is the boulder caves. 

There are 11 distinct caves spread along the boardwalk. Every cave is optional—you can simply walk around them if you prefer—but for the adventurous, they are irresistible. You’ll find yourself army-crawling through the “Lemon Squeezer,” sliding into the “Dungeon,” and marveling at the sheer size of the “Judgment Hall of Pluto.” It’s like a massive, natural jungle gym that engages kids entirely while blowing away the adults with its sheer scale.

### The Forest Adventure Trail & Treehouse
Before heading back to the car, take a lap around the upper ridge. They recently installed a massive suspension bridge that crosses the entire gorge, offering dizzying views straight down to the river. There is also a spectacular, multi-story treehouse and a massive bird-nest viewing platform that provides fantastic views of the Kinsman range.

## Practical Family Travel Details

When planning your Clark's & Lost River weekend, keep these tips in your back pocket:

*   **Timing is Everything:** August is peak season. Arrive right when the gates open for both attractions (usually around 9:00 AM) to beat the crowds entirely. You’ll have the first bear show entirely to yourself and skip the lines for the most popular caves.
*   **Lost River Footwear:** Leave the flip-flops at the hotel. You absolutely need sturdy, closed-toe sneakers or hiking shoes to safely navigate the wet, rocky floors of the boulder caves.
*   **Clark’s Food:** Unlike many massive theme parks, Clark's Bears is surprisingly relaxed about outside food. You can bring a cooler with sandwiches and utilize their sprawling, shaded picnic grove right by the train station.

## A Family-Friendly Basecamp

When you’re traveling with kids, convenience is priceless. Because Clark's Bears and Lost River are literally five minutes down the road in opposite directions, Inn 32 serves as the absolute geometric center for your family vacation. 

There is no hour-long commute at the end of an exhausting day. When the kids are tapped out, you can be back at the hotel in five minutes flat. Our spacious double-queen rooms and the massive Four Bedroom Suite offer plenty of room to spread out, and the outdoor fire pits are the perfect place for a final, quiet s'mores session before bed.
