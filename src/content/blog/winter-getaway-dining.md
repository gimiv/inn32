# A Winter Getaway: Dining and Relaxing in the Mountains

February in New Hampshire frequently delivers the deepest, most sustained cold of the year. The wind howls through Franconia Notch, and the snow piles incredibly high against the pine trees. For die-hard skiers, this is the best month of the year to chase deep powder. But what if you aren't a skier? What if you want to visit the mountains purely to enjoy the snowy scenery without actually strapping on snowshoes or freezing your fingers off? 

Sometimes the best winter vacation doesn't involve breaking a sweat at all. February's deep freeze is the absolute perfect excuse to slow down, indulge, and enjoy a cozy, relaxing mountain getaway that revolves entirely around comfort. 

The Lincoln and Woodstock area is packed with excellent indoor attractions and fantastic dining options. When the windchill drops below zero, here is how you can spend a perfect, warm winter weekend at Inn 32.

## The Art of the Cozy Dinner

The cornerstone of any relaxing winter weekend is a slow, multi-course dinner in a beautiful, historic setting. Because Inn 32 is located right in the center of the local dining scene, you have immediate access to the best restaurants in the county. 

### 1. The Common Man (Lincoln) 
This is arguably the crown jewel of comfortable New England dining. Situated in a massive, historic paper mill building right in downtown Lincoln, The Common Man is famous for its atmosphere. The soaring ceilings and exposed brick are centered around a roaring, massive stone fireplace that defines the main dining room.

This isn’t the place for a quick bite. You go to The Common Man to settle in. Start with their complimentary cheese and crackers in the parlor while you wait for a table, and then dive into hearty, warming comfort food like their famous baked mac & cheese, slow-braised short ribs, or the classic New England clam chowder. The portions are huge, the atmosphere is incredibly cozy, and you will leave completely satisfied.

### 2. The Woodstock Inn Brewery (North Woodstock)
If you prefer a lively, vibrant atmosphere over the crackling silence of a historic fireplace, simply walk down the street from our hotel to the Woodstock Inn Brewery. 

The food here goes far beyond standard pub fare. The menu is massive, featuring an incredible variety of massive comfort dishes perfectly suited to winter weather. Think thick-crust pizzas, piled-high pulled pork sandwiches, and their legendary "Nachos Grande." It is the perfect place to grab a flight of their house-brewed winter ales, hunker down in a dark corner booth, and listen to the live weekend music as the snow falls outside.

## Slower Winter Adventures

Even if you aren't skiing, you can still experience the stark beauty of the winter landscape without too much exertion.

*   **Scenic Drives:** Because the foliage is gone, the views of the massive granite peaks actually open up dramatically in the winter. Exploring the Kancamagus Highway in February is a completely different, silent experience. The waterfalls (like Sabbaday Falls and the Flume Gorge) freeze into staggering, massive blue ice columns that are easily accessible via a short walk. 
*   **The Spa:** If relaxing is the primary goal, treat yourself to a massage. The nearby Viaggio Spa at Loon Mountain Resort offers a full menu of deep tissue treatments, perfect for melting away the stress of the winter commute.

## The Perfect Basecamp at Inn 32

When the primary objective of your trip is to relax, your choice of hotel is the most important decision you will make. You don't want to spend your weekend driving back and forth to distant restaurants on icy, unlit mountain roads. 

At Inn 32, we prioritize that sense of effortless comfort. When you return from a massive dinner at The Common Man, your room is ready to serve as your private retreat. Every freshly renovated room features deeply supportive beds piled high with premium duvets, massive flat-screen smart TVs perfect for a movie night, and the convenience of a modern, walk-in glass shower that lets you thaw out the instant you walk through the door.

If you aren't quite ready to call it a night, simply grab a complimentary coffee or tea from the lobby, put on a thick coat, and sit by our outdoor fire pits. Taking the time to simply enjoy the crisp mountain air under a sky full of stars—without anywhere you have to be—is the true magic of a winter getaway.
