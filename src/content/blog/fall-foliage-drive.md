# Chasing Colors: The Ultimate Fall Foliage Drive

There completely is no debate: October in the White Mountains is the most spectacular time of year. As the summer heat fades and the daylight hours shorten, the sprawling, unbroken forests undergo a breathtaking transformation. The rich greens give way to a brilliant, rolling sea of crimson red, fiery orange, and vibrant gold. People travel from all over the world to witness this seasonal spectacle, known colloquially as "leaf peeping."

If you’ve booked a fall stay at Inn 32 in North Woodstock, you are perfectly positioned at the gateway to the most famous foliage drive in the entire country: the Kancamagus Highway. This 34-mile scenic byway cuts directly through the heart of the White Mountain National Forest, offering unparalleled views of the color change. 

Here is our ultimate guide to navigating the "Kanc" and making the most of your New England autumn adventure.

## The Historic Kancamagus Highway

The Kancamagus Highway (Route 112) is unique because it is entirely free of commercial development. Unlike most major roads, you won't find a single gas station, hotel, or restaurant along its 34-mile length between Lincoln and Conway. It is simply a winding two-lane ribbon of asphalt cutting through pure, unadulterated wilderness, climbing almost 3,000 feet in elevation to the summit of Kancamagus Pass.

Because development is restricted, the views remain pristine. Every twist and turn of the road reveals a new, staggering vista of color. It is consistently named one of the top scenic drives in America, and witnessing it during peak foliage is an experience that simply cannot be captured in photographs.

## Unmissable Stops Along the Route

While the drive itself is the main event, the National Forest Service maintains a series of incredible pull-offs and short hiking trails that are essential stops.

### 1. The Hancock Overlook 
Located right near the highest point of the pass (and just about 15 minutes from Inn 32), this massive paved pull-off offers one of the most famous views of the highway. Because of the high elevation, the colors here turn earlier than they do down in the valley, creating a spectacular, sweeping view of the Osceola mountain range.

### 2. Sabbaday Falls
About halfway across the highway on the eastern side of the pass, you’ll find the trailhead for Sabbaday Falls. This is a very short (just over half a mile), incredibly accessible, packed-gravel handicap-accessible path that leads to a thunderous, three-tiered waterfall. The contrast of the rushing water plunging through a narrow granite gorge, surrounded by bright yellow birch leaves, is absolutely stunning.

### 3. The Covered Bridges
No trip to New Hampshire is complete without seeing a historic covered bridge. The Kancamagus features the beautiful Albany Covered Bridge across the Swift River. The dark, weathered wood of the bridge framed perfectly by the fiery autumn canopy is a quintessential New England photo opportunity. 

## Strategic Leaf Peeping 

Timing a foliage trip requires a bit of strategy, as the "peak" color is entirely dependent on the weather and changes every single year.

*   **The Golden Window:** Generally, the color begins to turn in mid-to-late September. The absolute peak (when the reds and oranges are most vibrant before the leaves begin to drop) usually hits the North Woodstock area in the first two weeks of October. 
*   **The Elevation Factor:** The colors change at high elevations first. If you arrive in late September and the leaves around Inn 32 are still green, simply drive 15 minutes up the Kancamagus Highway—you’ll find peak color at the top of the pass. Conversely, if you arrive in late October, head south toward Plymouth where the lower-elevation valleys are just reaching their prime.
*   **Beat the Crowds:** The Kancamagus Highway is world-famous. On a sunny Saturday in October, the road can become a parking lot. For the best experience, we highly recommend taking the drive on a weekday morning. You will have the overlooks and trails mostly to yourself!
