Summer in the White Mountains brings intense sunshine and heat that can turn even the most enthusiastic hikers toward water. When temperatures climb into the 80s, nothing beats cooling off in mountain lakes, rivers, and swimming holes near North Woodstock. This guide covers the best water activities in the region, from scenic kayaking to refreshing swims, helping you enjoy White Mountains summer without overheating.

## Water Recreation in the White Mountains

The mountains that dominate the landscape around North Woodstock provide year-round water sources—from cascading waterfalls fed by snowmelt to pristine mountain lakes surrounded by forest. Summer offers the perfect season to enjoy these water features, which maintain surprisingly cold temperatures even during hot weather.

Mountain water stays cold year-round because it comes from high elevation snowmelt and deep groundwater sources. Even in July and August, mountain lakes rarely exceed 65-70 degrees Fahrenheit. Rivers are similarly refreshing. This natural cooling makes water activities the perfect complement to hiking, wildlife watching, and scenic exploration.

## Cascade Park Swimming

Cascade Park in Woodstock (just south of North Woodstock) offers the region's most accessible natural swimming option. The park centers around a series of cascades and pools created by the Pemigewasset River. Crystal-clear water flows through rocky terrain, creating inviting pools perfect for swimming and wading.

### Visiting Cascade Park

**Parking and Access** - Cascade Park provides free parking and easy public access. Paths lead from the parking area to various cascades and pools. The walk from parking to primary swimming areas is less than a quarter mile, making it accessible for families with young children.

**Swimming Pools** - Natural pools created by the river vary in depth from ankle-deep wading areas to deep pools suitable for swimming. Summer currents are manageable, though always respect water movement and avoid areas with strong current.

**Picnic Facilities** - Cascade Park includes picnic areas, grills, and restrooms. Many families pack lunch and spend entire afternoons here, alternating swimming with eating and relaxing on river rocks.

### What to Bring

- Swimsuit and quick-dry clothing
- Water shoes or sandals (river rocks are slippery)
- Towel
- Sunscreen (reflection off water intensifies sun exposure)
- Cooler with snacks and beverages
- Waterproof bag for valuables

### Safety Considerations

While Cascade Park swimming is generally safe, current and water depth vary depending on recent rainfall and snowmelt. Always:
- Check water conditions before entering
- Never swim alone
- Stay out of areas with strong current
- Wear water shoes on slippery rocks
- Know your swimming ability and respect water limits

## Mountain Lake Kayaking

Several mountain lakes near North Woodstock offer excellent kayaking opportunities. Unlike rivers with current and varying conditions, lakes provide calm water perfect for paddlers of varying experience.

### Greeley Ponds

Greeley Ponds, accessible via hiking trail from the Kancamagus Highway, consists of two pristine mountain ponds set at about 2,400 feet elevation. The first pond (Lower Greeley) offers excellent kayaking opportunities. Paddling here immerses you in mountain scenery—evergreen forests surround the water, and peaks frame distant views.

Reaching Greeley Ponds requires hiking 3+ miles, making this option for adventurous paddlers willing to carry kayaks through forest. However, the resulting solitude and pristine scenery make the effort worthwhile.

### Newfound Lake

Newfound Lake, about 30 minutes south of North Woodstock near Bristol, is larger and more developed than Greeley Ponds. Public boat launches provide water access without hiking. The lake offers 4+ miles of paddling with scenic shorelines, wooded islands, and mountain views.

Newfound Lake is busier than remote mountain ponds but still feels quieter than typical summer lake recreation. Kayaking here provides peaceful exploration with easier access.

### Squam Lake

Squam Lake, famous from the movie "On Golden Pond," lies about 35 minutes southwest of North Woodstock. This massive lake offers extensive paddling, beautiful islands, and mountain views. Public launches and rental centers provide water access for those without their own kayaks.

Squam Lake is busier and more developed than smaller mountain lakes, but still offers excellent paddling. The lake's size means paddlers can find quieter areas by venturing away from launch sites and developed areas.

## River Wading Spots

For refreshing dips without committing to full kayaking, river wading spots offer quick relief from heat. The region's multiple rivers provide options based on your location and preferences.

### Pemigewasset River Wading

The Pemigewasset River runs through North Woodstock, offering numerous access points. Popular wading areas include:
- Cascade Park (mentioned above)
- Various pull-offs along Route 175
- Areas near Route 3 where roads approach the river

### Swift River

The Swift River drains from the Kancamagus Highway area and provides excellent water access. Multiple locations along the Kancamagus offer pull-offs leading to swimming holes and wading areas. The scenic drive combined with water access makes this an excellent half-day activity.

### East Branch Pemigewasset

The East Branch offers pristine water and forest scenery. Access points near Lincoln and along local roads provide wading opportunities in wilder terrain than more developed areas.

## Practical Tips for Water Activities

### Respect Current and Conditions

Mountain rivers appear calm but carry significant current, especially after rainfall or during high snowmelt periods. Never underestimate water power. Wade only in areas where you can easily touch bottom and easily exit. Avoid areas with visible strong current.

### Protect Your Skin

- Apply sunscreen before and reapply after swimming
- Bring a lightweight shirt or rash guard for sun protection
- Consider water shoes for protecting feet from rocks
- Wear a hat when wading in open sun

### Transportation

If kayaking on lakes away from North Woodstock, plan transportation carefully. Trailhead parking fills during peak summer. Arrive early or visit mid-week. Never leave valuables visible in vehicles.

### Pack Smart

Bring only essentials to water areas. Pack water bottles (mountain water isn't always safe to drink), snacks, first aid supplies, and sun protection. Leave electronics behind or protect them in waterproof cases.

## Combining Water Activities with Other Adventures

Water recreation pairs perfectly with other White Mountains activities. You might:
- Hike to water access points, combining exercise with cooling off
- Kayak in morning, then spend afternoon hiking (or vice versa)
- Visit Cascade Park for swimming, then explore nearby attractions
- Combine river wading with scenic drives on the Kancamagus Highway
