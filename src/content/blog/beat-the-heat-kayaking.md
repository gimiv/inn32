# Beat the Heat: Kayaking and River Wading

When the heart of July hits the White Mountains, the crisp spring air is entirely replaced by the intense heat of high summer. While the dense canopies of the regional hiking trails offer fantastic shade, there are days when the humidity makes even a modest climb feel exhausting. On those sweltering summer afternoons, the only right answer is to seek out the pristine, icy mountain waters that define the Franconia Notch and North Woodstock area.

Whether you prefer the tranquil relaxation of wading in the shallows right off Main Street or the active, scenic paddle of a kayak across a glassy lake, Inn 32 is perfectly situated near the best cooling-off spots in the region. Here is our guide to beating the heat and making a splash on your next summer vacation.

## The Ultimate Convenience: Cascade Park

When guests at Inn 32 ask for a spot to cool off without having to pack the car and drive into the mountains, we point them directly to our backyard. Hidden just one street off the main drag of North Woodstock sits Cascade Park, one of the most idyllic, accessible swimming spots in the state. 

Accessed via an inconspicuous path behind the local shops, the park sits right on the Pemigewasset River. What makes Cascade Park so special is its unique geography. The river flows over large, impossibly smooth slabs of granite, creating a series of small, natural cascading waterfalls—hence the name.

These cascading rock formations create deep, crystal-clear plunge pools perfect for swimming, while the wide, flat granite slabs provide a natural patio for sunbathing. The water is entirely snowmelt-fed, meaning it remains shockingly, refreshingly cold even on a 90-degree August afternoon. 

It is incredibly common to see families and couples set up camp chairs directly in the ankle-deep shallows, letting the rushing water flow over their feet while they read a book or enjoy a picnic lunch from down the street. Because it’s located practically across the street from Inn 32, it’s the perfect place to spend a lazy couple of hours before heading back to your room for an afternoon rest.

## Padding Paradise: Echo Lake at Franconia Notch

If you’re looking to get out onto the water rather than just wade in it, there is no more scenic spot than Echo Lake. Located about 15 minutes north of Inn 32 in the heart of Franconia Notch State Park, this pristine, 39-acre lake offers an unparalleled paddling experience. 

Echo Lake sits directly beneath the towering, sheer cliffs of Cannon Mountain. The view from the center of the lake—staring straight up the rocky face of the mountain while surrounded by dense, unbroken forest—is simply breathtaking. Because no motorized boats are allowed, the water remains glassy and the atmosphere deeply peaceful. 

*   **Rentals:** You don’t need to drag your own equipment up the highway! The state park operates a rental shack right on the sandy beach during the summer season. They offer canoes, kayaks, and stand-up paddleboards by the hour.
*   **The Beach:** Aside from boating, Echo Lake is also popular for its small swimming beach. It’s perfect for younger kids who might not be interested in navigating the rocky riverbeds of the Pemigewasset. The sandy slope provides a gentle entry into the clear, cool water.

## Pro Tips for Mountain Water Safety

The rivers and lakes in the White Mountains are beautiful, but they are also rugged and natural environments. A few quick safety tips will ensure a perfect afternoon:

*   **Watch the Current:** If you’re swimming in moving water (like the Pemigewasset River), always respect the current. Heavy rains, even storms miles upstream, can drastically increase the water flow and depth in a matter of hours.
*   **Water Shoes:** The granite riverbeds are notoriously slippery due to natural algae, and the rocks can be sharp. Pack a pair of water shoes or athletic sandals with a heel strap rather than flip-flops. You’ll be much more comfortable navigating the pools.
*   **Sun Protection:** Altitude matters. The sun is surprisingly intense in the White Mountains, and the reflection off the water will fry you faster than you expect. Reapply sunscreen frequently.
