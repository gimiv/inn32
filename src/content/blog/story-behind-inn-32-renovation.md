# Cozying Up: The Story Behind Our Renovation

Late November in the White Mountains is a beautifully quiet, transitional time. The brilliant explosion of fall foliage has faded, and the first significant snowfalls haven't quite yet blanketed the high peaks to kick off the ski season. It’s the perfect time to slow down, head indoors, and embrace the concept of "cozy." 

For us at Inn 32, this quiet season is also a time of reflection. It marks the culmination of a massive, passionate project: the complete, top-to-bottom renovation of our boutique hotel. If you’ve stayed with us recently, you’ve experienced the fresh design and modern comforts. But the story of how we transformed a classic roadside inn into a premier destination is a labor of love we’ve been eager to share.

## Honoring a Roadside Legacy

North Woodstock has a rich history as a bustling hub for travelers heading north into Franconia Notch. For decades, the property that is now Inn 32 served as a traditional, reliable motor lodge—a place where families on road trips could pull right up to their doors after a long day of driving. 

When we acquired the property, we knew we had a unique opportunity. The "bones" of the building were fantastic, and the location—sitting right on Main Street but backed up against the quiet Pemigewasset River—was unbeatable. Our goal wasn't to tear down history; it was to honor that classic American road-trip legacy while completely reimagining the interior to meet the expectations of the modern, design-conscious traveler.

## A Modern, Boutique Transformation

The renovation was exhaustive. We took every single room down to the studs, fundamentally changing the layout and the feel of the spaces to prioritize light, comfort, and cleanliness. 

### From the Ground Up
We started with the fundamentals. New subflooring, advanced soundproofing between the walls, and entirely new HVAC systems ensure that every room is quiet and perfectly climate-controlled, regardless of the harsh New England weather outside. We replaced the old, drafty windows with massive, energy-efficient panes that flood the rooms with natural mountain light.

### Designing for Comfort
When it came to the interior design, we aimed for an aesthetic we call "Mountain Modern." 
*   **The Palette:** We moved away from the heavy, dark pine paneling typical of older mountain lodges. Instead, we utilized a bright, clean color palette centered around rich navy blues, crisp whites, and warm, natural wood tones that reflect the surrounding landscape.
*   **The Beds:** A hotel is only as good as its beds. We invested heavily in premium, incredibly supportive mattresses, piled high with high-thread-count linens and plush duvets that feel like heaven after a long day of hiking or skiing.
*   **The Details:** Every room features custom-built, open-concept wardrobes, smart TVs, and integrated charging stations. We wanted the rooms to feel incredibly functional without feeling cluttered.

## The Bathroom Revolution

If there is one aspect of the renovation we are most proud of, it is the bathrooms. In our experience, the bathroom is what ultimately defines a truly premium hotel stay. 

We completely demolished the small, dated bathrooms of the old motor lodge. In their place, we built massive, spa-like retreats. Every room now features a stunning, oversized walk-in glass shower. We used beautiful, floor-to-ceiling subway tile, installed premium rainfall showerheads, and equipped every vanity with bright, flattering LED mirror lighting. It’s entirely unlike anything you’d expect from an exterior-corridor building.

## Extending the Experience Outdoors

While the rooms were the focus, we knew the exterior spaces were just as important. The White Mountains are all about the outdoors, and we wanted our property to facilitate that connection.

We completely redesigned the exterior landscaping and walkways, adding warm, ambient lighting that makes the property glow invitingly in the evening. Most importantly, we added our signature outdoor fire pits. These spaces have become the social heart of Inn 32. In the late fall and winter, there is nothing better than grabbing a complimentary hot cocoa or a local craft beer, pulling up an Adirondack chair, and sharing stories by the fire with fellow travelers. 

## Your Modern Mountain Basecamp

The reception to the renovation has been overwhelming. We set out to create a space that feels like a hidden gem—a place where you get the convenience of a Main Street location paired with the luxury and design of a high-end boutique property. 

As the quiet month of November rolls on, we couldn't be more proud of the cozy, modern retreat we've built. We handled the hard work of the renovation so all you have to do is relax.
