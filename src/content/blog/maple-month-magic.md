March transforms the White Mountains into a sticky-sweet wonderland where maple syrup season reaches its peak. If you're planning a springtime escape to North Woodstock, New Hampshire, Maple Month offers the perfect reason to visit Inn 32 and explore the region's rich sugaring traditions. From watching sap boil down to golden liquid to tasting fresh maple taffy on clean snow, this is New Hampshire's most delicious seasonal celebration.

## What is NH Maple Month?

New Hampshire officially celebrates Maple Month throughout March, though the sugaring season actually runs from late February through April. This is when the combination of freezing nights and warming days creates the ideal conditions for sap to flow in maple trees. Sugarhouse operators throughout the White Mountains open their doors to visitors, demonstrating centuries-old techniques and inviting guests to taste the fruits of their labor.

North Woodstock sits in the heart of New Hampshire's premier maple country. The region's numerous sugarhouses are just minutes away from Inn 32, making it an ideal base for experiencing this quintessential New England tradition. Whether you're a maple syrup enthusiast or simply curious about where this liquid gold comes from, Maple Month offers educational experiences that the whole family will enjoy.

### Why March Matters for Maple Syrup

Maple syrup production depends on specific weather patterns. Trees need frozen nights—when sap is drawn down into the roots—followed by warm, sunny days that coax the sap back up into the trunk. March in the White Mountains typically provides these ideal conditions. The frozen ground of winter combined with increasing daytime temperatures creates perfect conditions for the sugar maple trees that dominate the northern New England forests.

This narrow window of opportunity means serious maple producers work around the clock during sugaring season. Evaporators run 24/7, and many sugarhouses offer late-afternoon and evening tours so visitors can watch the boiling process—something truly mesmerizing when you're standing in a warm sugarhouse while steam rises from the enormous evaporator pans.

## Must-Visit Sugarhouses Near North Woodstock

### Bascom's Sugar House

Located just south of North Woodstock in Bethlehem, Bascom's is one of the region's oldest and most respected sugarhouses. Their family has been sugaring for generations, and they welcome visitors throughout Maple Month. You'll see the boiling process firsthand and can purchase pure maple syrup in various grades—from light golden delicate taste to dark robust taste.

Bascom's also offers maple cream and maple sugar candy that makes perfect souvenirs. Many guests enjoy picking up a few bottles to bring home after a night at Inn 32. The store adjoins the production area, so you get the full experience from sap to finished product.

### Creswell's Sugar House

Creswell's operates at the foot of Cannon Mountain and provides authentic, old-time sugaring demonstrations. This working sugarhouse shows visitors how maple syrup production has evolved over time, combining traditional methods with modern efficiency. Their gift shop features not just maple syrup but also maple-infused foods and products.

### Hilltop Orchards Maple House

While known primarily as an orchard, Hilltop's maple operations are equally impressive. They process sap from local producers and create specialty maple products. Their location offers beautiful views across the Pemigewasset Valley toward the White Mountains ridges.

## Experience Maple on Snow (Sugar on Snow)

One of Maple Month's most iconic traditions is "sugar on snow"—thick maple syrup boiled to the soft-ball stage and poured onto clean snow where it hardens into a chewy candy that you roll up on a wooden stick and eat. Most sugarhouses serving visitors offer this traditional treat.

It's messier and stickier than expected, which makes it even more fun. Bring a coat you don't mind getting sticky, and be prepared for a sugar rush. Pair it with a simple pastry or pickle to cut the sweetness—New Englanders have been enjoying this combination for centuries.

When you return to Inn 32 after a day of sugaring, you'll have plenty to talk about. Consider booking one of our [comfortable rooms](/rooms) where you can relax and reflect on your maple adventures.

## Maple Festivals and Events

Throughout March, communities across the White Mountains host Maple Festival weekends. These events typically feature multiple sugarhouses open for tours, craft vendors selling maple-related products, demonstrations of traditional crafts, and plenty of maple-flavored food samples.

Lincoln, just west of North Woodstock, often hosts special Maple Month programming. These festivals provide a concentrated way to experience multiple sugarhouses and local businesses in one day, though you'll want to arrive early as popular events draw crowds.

## Planning Your Maple Month Visit

### Best Time to Visit

Mid to late March typically offers the most consistent sap flow and the most sugarhouse activity. However, warm spells in early March can also be productive. Check ahead with specific sugarhouses before visiting, as production can be unpredictable depending on weather conditions.

### What to Bring

- Layers—sugarhouses are hot near the evaporator but cool elsewhere
- Comfortable walking shoes
- Small towels or napkins for sticky fingers
- A camera for capturing the boiling process
- Cash, as some smaller operations are cash-only

### Timing Your Visit

Most sugarhouses open in the late afternoon (around 3 PM) and operate into the evening. This is when the boiling process is most active and atmospheric. Plan to spend 45 minutes to an hour at each sugarhouse. If you visit multiple locations, you'll easily fill a full day.
