# Welcoming Summer: Ziplining and Aerial Adventures

As the snow finally melts away from the highest peaks and the verdant green canopy returns to the White Mountains, the energy in North Woodstock shifts entirely. While hiking and relaxing by the river are quintessential summer activities, there is another way to experience the dense mountain forests that you simply can't get from the ground: taking to the skies.

If you’re looking to inject a serious dose of adrenaline into your summer vacation, ziplining through the sprawling canopies of the Franconia region is a must-do. Just a short drive—or walk—from Inn 32 sitsAlpine Adventures, the premier destination for soaring above the trees. Whether you are an experienced thrill-seeker or trying an aerial course for the very first time, a zipline tour is the perfect way to kick off the summer season.

## The Alpine Adventures Experience

Alpine Adventures revolutionized the outdoor recreation scene in New England when they opened the first zipline canopy tour in the region over a decade ago. Since then, they have expanded into a massive, multi-faceted operation that draws adventurers from all over the country.

What makes their tours so unique is the setting. You aren’t just zipping across an open field; the cables are strung high above the forest floor, crisscrossing deep ravines, rushing streams, and steep ridges on private land atop Barron Mountain. 

The experience begins right in downtown Lincoln. After checking in, you’re suited up with a professional climbing harness and helmet. Then comes the first thrill: the ride to the top. You’ll board a massive, 6-wheel drive Pinzgauer (a Swiss military off-road vehicle) that crawls up the incredibly steep, rugged mountain terrain to reach the start of the course. It’s a bumpy, laugh-inducing ride that sets the tone for the rest of the adventure.

## Choosing Your Zipline Tour

Alpine Adventures offers a few different courses, allowing you to choose the level of thrill that suits you or your family best.

### The Tree-Top Canopy Tour
This is the original course and a fantastic starting point for families or those who might be slightly nervous about heights. It features shorter, lower zips that wind through the beautiful hemlock and pine forests. You’ll cross suspension bridges and learn the basics of ziplining under the watchful eye of their expert guides.

### The Sky Rider Tour
If you want to go faster, higher, and further, the Sky Rider is the tour for you. Designed for maximum adrenaline, this high-flying course features some of the longest and fastest zips in the region. You’ll routinely hit speeds that will make your eyes water as you soar hundreds of feet above the valley floor, taking in unobstructed views of the Kinsman and Franconia ranges.

### The Super Sky Rider
For the ultimate thrill-seekers, the Super Sky Rider takes everything to the extreme. It operates on a different, more isolated part of Barron Mountain, offering profound natural beauty and silence between the heart-pumping rides. These are the longest zips they offer, requiring nerves of steel and a true love of heights.

## Beyond Ziplining: Thrills on the Ground

If flying through the air isn't for everyone in your group, Alpine Adventures still has plenty to offer right on the ground.

*   **Off-Road Safari Tours:** You can book an extended version of the Pinzgauer ride. These rugged, 6-wheel drive monsters take you deep into the 300-acre private reserve, splashing through mud puddles and navigating staggering inclines that seem physically impossible. It’s an immersive, guided tour of the local ecology and history, wrapped in a thrilling off-road package.
*   **Thrillsville Aerial Park:** Located right at their Main Street headquarters, this self-guided ropes course lets you test your balance and climbing skills. It’s packed with suspended bridges, cargo nets, and challenging obstacles, making it a perfect afternoon activity for energetic kids and adults alike.

## Practical Details for Your Adventure

To make the most of your aerial adventure, preparation is key:

*   **Booking:** During peak summer weekends (July and August), tours sell out quickly. We highly recommend booking your tour online several weeks in advance.
*   **What to Wear:** Closed-toe shoes (like sneakers or hiking boots) are required. Avoid loose clothing that could get tangled in the gear, and remember that it’s often cooler up on the mountain than it is down in the village, so bringing a light layer is smart.
*   **Requirements:** Pay close attention to the age and weight requirements when booking, as they vary significantly between the different tours for safety reasons.
*   **Photos:** You cannot hold your phone while ziplining, but Alpine’s expert guides take fantastic photos throughout the tour that you can purchase afterward. Alternately, you can rent a helmet-mounted GoPro to film the entire ride!

## Relaxing After the Rush

Ziplining is physically engaging and mentally exhilarating, meaning you’ll likely be exhausted (in the best way possible) by the time you unclip your harness. 

When the adrenaline finally wears off, Inn 32 is just minutes away. Head back to the property, grab a cold drink, and relax on the outdoor patio or warm up by the fire pits as the sun goes down.
