Winter transforms the White Mountains into one of New England's premier skiing destinations. Cannon Mountain and Loon Mountain, both near North Woodstock, offer excellent skiing with distinct characteristics. Whether you're a powder-seeking expert or learning beginner, understanding these resorts' differences helps you choose the experience matching your interests and abilities. This guide compares both mountains, helping you plan your White Mountains ski vacation based at Inn 32.

## Why Ski Near North Woodstock?

Both major White Mountains ski resorts sit within 30 minutes of North Woodstock. This proximity means:

- **Convenient Base** - Stay at Inn 32 and ski different mountains on different days without changing accommodations
- **Non-Skier Options** - Families with mixed interests can coordinate ski days with non-ski activities
- **Easy Access** - No need to drive over 4 hours like skiers visiting from southern New England
- **Après-Ski Recovery** - Return to your comfortable room at Inn 32 rather than driving exhausted after long days
- **Extended Stays** - The region's non-ski winter activities (Ice Castles, hiking, dining) work perfectly alongside skiing

## Cannon Mountain Overview

Cannon Mountain, owned by the state of New Hampshire, sits within Franconia Notch State Park. The peak rises to 4,080 feet with significant vertical drop and challenging terrain. Cannon is known for serious skiing and distinctive character.

### Terrain and Difficulty

**Vertical Drop** - 2,180 feet, among New England's largest.

**Terrain Distribution** - Roughly 30% beginner, 50% intermediate, 20% expert. This means limited beginner terrain but plenty for intermediate and advanced skiers.

**Notable Terrain** - Tuckerman Ravine Headwall and nearby peaks offer extreme backcountry skiing opportunities for highly skilled adventurers. Within-bounds skiing includes challenging cliff terrain only for experts.

**Character** - Cannon's terrain feels genuinely mountain skiing—steep pitches, minimal grooming on expert terrain, and exposure create the sensation of skiing in serious mountains rather than manicured resorts.

### Lifts and Access

**The Aerial Tramway** - Cannon's iconic 80-passenger tramway climbs from base to summit in eight minutes. The ride itself is memorable—a piece of New Hampshire skiing heritage dating to 1938. However, the tramway can have long waits during peak periods.

**Chair Lifts** - Multiple chairlifts provide alternative access and serve different terrain zones.

**Access Considerations** - Franconia Notch's elevation and mountain location mean snowfall can be unreliable. Early and late season conditions might see rain instead of snow at lower elevations while higher peaks receive powder.

### Amenities and Services

**Base Facilities** - Cannon operates efficiently but without the extensive amenities of larger resorts. The atmosphere emphasizes skiing over entertainment.

**Food Service** - Multiple dining options exist, though selections are more limited than major commercial resorts.

**Lessons and Rentals** - Available but sometimes with waits during peak periods.

**Parking** - Parking fills during weekends; arrival by 8:30 AM recommended.

### Who Chooses Cannon?

- Serious skiers wanting challenging terrain
- Those seeking New England's classic ski experience
- Visitors interested in iconic Franconia Notch scenery
- Intermediate skiers wanting to improve quickly
- Backcountry skiers using the resort as access to wilderness terrain

## Loon Mountain Overview

Loon Mountain, a privately operated resort in Lincoln, represents full-service ski destination. The mountain emphasizes family-friendly operations alongside quality skiing and expansive amenities.

### Terrain and Difficulty

**Vertical Drop** - 2,100 feet, comparable to Cannon, though the mountain feels less steep.

**Terrain Distribution** - Approximately 15% beginner, 65% intermediate, 20% expert. Extensive intermediate terrain makes Loon excellent for improving skiers and families.

**Beginner Focus** - Dedicated beginner areas with gentle slopes and learning-focused programs make Loon particularly strong for first-time skiers.

**Intermediate Heaven** - The majority of terrain falls in intermediate range—smooth, well-groomed runs providing confidence-building skiing. This makes Loon ideal for skiers advancing beyond beginner stages.

**Expert Terrain** - North Peak provides challenging runs, though less extreme than Cannon's wildest terrain.

### Lifts and Access

**Chairlifts** - Multiple modern chairlifts, including high-speed quads that minimize wait times and provide quick access to various terrain zones.

**Gondola** - A scenic gondola provides weather-protected access during inclement conditions.

**Wait Time Efficiency** - Loon's lift system generally moves skiers efficiently. Extended waits are less common than at Cannon.

**Base Lodge** - The modern base lodge provides everything skiers need in comfortable, contemporary facility.

### Amenities and Services

**Comprehensive Services** - Loon features dining, rentals, lessons, childcare, equipment shops, and entertainment. Everything needed for complete ski resort experience is on-site.

**Family Services** - Childcare options let non-skiing family members enjoy the day separately. Kids clubs keep children engaged while parents ski.

**Dining Variety** - Multiple restaurants and cafeterias offer choices beyond typical ski resort food.

**Shops and Entertainment** - Beyond skiing, Loon offers nightlife, indoor activities, and entertainment options.

**Parking** - Large parking lots accommodate peak crowds better than Cannon. However, weekends still fill; early arrival recommended.

### Who Chooses Loon?

- Family skiers wanting comprehensive amenities
- Intermediate skiers seeking quality groomed terrain
- First-time skiers wanting learning-focused programs
- Visitors wanting ski day combined with non-ski entertainment
- Those preferring modern facilities and efficient operations

## Planning Your White Mountains Ski Trip

### Sample Two-Day Ski Itinerary

**Day One**
- Morning departure from Inn 32 to Loon Mountain
- Full day skiing varied terrain
- Afternoon/early evening return to Inn 32
- Evening dining and relaxation

**Day Two**
- Breakfast at Inn 32
- Drive to Cannon Mountain

This allows experiencing both mountains while maintaining Inn 32 as comfortable base.

### Single Mountain Strategy

If time allows only one mountain:

**Choose Loon if** - First-time skier, mixed ability family, prefer amenities and varied terrain, early/late season visit.

**Choose Cannon if** - Advanced skier, seeking challenging terrain, visiting mid-winter when snow is reliable, want classic New England experience.

### Multi-Day Strategies

With 3+ days, you might:
- Full day at Loon + full day at Cannon + day of other activities
- Two days at one mountain (learning multiple runs) + one day at other mountain
- Mix skiing with non-ski activities (see our [Ice Castles guide](/lincoln-ice-castles) and [winter dining suggestions](/winter-getaway-dining))

## Equipment and Preparation

### Rentals vs. Bringing Your Own

Both resorts provide excellent rental equipment. Unless you have specialized needs or skis tuned specifically to your preferences, rentals work well. This saves travel luggage and provides reliable equipment.

### Lessons and Clinics

Both mountains offer lessons for all abilities:
- **Beginners** - Group or private lessons in basics
- **Intermediates** - Technique clinics for improvement
- **Advanced** - Specialized instruction for specific techniques

Investing in a lesson—especially on less familiar terrain—accelerates improvement and increases confidence.

### Physical Preparation

Skiing requires muscle groups and cardiovascular fitness some people aren't accustomed to. If you don't ski regularly:
- Warm up before pushing hard
- Take breaks to prevent fatigue-induced mistakes
- Stay hydrated (high elevation and sun intensity dehydrate faster than expected)
- Listen to your body—fatigue and soreness indicate you're working appropriate intensity

## Weather and Conditions

### Checking Conditions

Both mountains maintain websites with current conditions, recent snowfall, and open terrain status. Check before driving to avoid disappointment.

- Cannon: cannonmt.com
- Loon: loonmtn.com

### Dressing for Skiing

- Base layers (merino wool excellent)
- Insulating mid-layer (fleece or light down)
- Waterproof outer layer (jacket and pants)
- Gloves/mittens (bring extras; wet gloves lead to numb hands)
- Hat and neck gaiter
- Sunscreen (critical—snow reflects sun intensely)
- Quality ski socks (normal socks lead to cold feet)

### Driving in Winter

Both mountains sit in mountain terrain where conditions change rapidly. Drive carefully, especially on Franconia Notch road to Cannon. Snow chains or appropriate tires might be necessary during heavy snow.

## Recovery at Inn 32

After skiing, your body needs recovery:

**Warm Shower** - Soothe muscles and reduce immediate soreness.

**Stretching and Recovery** - Gentle stretching improves next-day mobility.

**Hot Beverages** - Warming from inside helps body recover. Hot chocolate, coffee, or tea work.

**Quality Rest** - Our [comfortable rooms](/rooms) provide spaces to truly relax and recover.

**Proper Meals** - Ski days burn significant calories. Substantial meals replenish energy stores.
