# Hitting the Slopes: Skiing Cannon and Loon

January is the undisputed heart of the White Mountains ski season. The massive holiday crowds of late December have finally thinned out, the temperatures are consistently dropping below freezing allowing the snowmaking crews to work around the clock, and the natural nor'easter storm tracks guarantee a steady influx of fresh powder. 

When you book a winter stay at Inn 32 in North Woodstock, you are perfectly situated directly between two of the most iconic, diverse ski resorts in New England: Cannon Mountain in Franconia Notch, and Loon Mountain Resort in Lincoln. Each massive mountain offers a completely distinct skiing experience, and because we are located less than 15 minutes from both, you don't even have to choose between them! 

Here is our insider's guide to maximizing your time carving the deep winter snowpack at Cannon and Loon.

## Cannon Mountain: The Steeps and The Legend

Cannon Mountain is a true skier's mountain. Owned and operated by the State of New Hampshire, it is located within the dramatic, imposing granite walls of Franconia Notch State Park. There is virtually no commercial development at the base—no sprawling condo complexes or massive shopping centers. The focus here is 100% pure, unadulterated vertical. 

With over 2,100 feet of vertical drop, Cannon boasts some of the steepest, most challenging terrain in New England. The mountain often takes the brunt of brutal winter weather sweeping through the notch, leading to the local saying that "if you can ski Cannon, you can ski anywhere." 

### The Trails That Define Cannon
*   **The Front Five:** This is where legends are made. The series of steep, legendary trails plunging straight down the front face of the mountain—like *Avalanche*, *Paulie’s Folly*, and *Zoomer*—are almost always covered in massive, challenging moguls. They are a rite of passage for any advanced East Coast skier.
*   **The Mittersill Terrain:** Cannon recently massively expanded their backcountry access by cutting trails into the adjacent Mittersill peak. While there is a double chairlift that services the area, it is intentionally left un-groomed. It offers an incredible, wild, gladed skiing experience right on the resort footprint.
*   **The Tram:** Cannon is home to the only aerial tramway in New Hampshire. Taking the massive 80-passenger tram car to the 4,080-foot summit is an experience in itself, offering sweeping views of the entire Pemigewasset valley—as long as the peak isn't socked in a cloud!

## Loon Mountain: Massive Variety and Park Laps

Just down the road in Lincoln, Loon Mountain sits on the opposite end of the spectrum. While Cannon is rugged and state-owned, Loon is a massively developed, modern resort experience. It is the most accessible major ski resort in the state via I-93, drawing huge crowds from Boston and beyond.

Loon spreads its 61 trails across three separate peaks, offering a staggering variety of terrain. Whether you are teaching young kids on the bunny slopes, laying down massive carving turns on wide-open corduroy groomers, or launching off massive kickers in the progressive terrain parks, Loon truly has something for everyone.

### What Makes Loon Special
*   **The Grooming:** Loon is legendary for its snowmaking and grooming operations. Even during a low-snow winter, the massive, wide cruisers on the North Peak are almost always covered in a perfect, edge-holding corduroy surface. 
*   **The Parks:** If you (or your kids) prefer to spend the day hitting jumps and sliding rails, Loon is arguably the best mountain in New England. They dedicate an incredible amount of acreage to their progressive terrain parks, culminating in a massive superpipe located right at the base area. 
*   **The Eight:** Loon recently installed the Kancamagus 8, the most technologically advanced chairlift in North America. This massive 8-passenger, high-speed lift features heated seats and a weather-blocking bubble, making the ride to the summit incredibly fast and comfortable even on the coldest January mornings.

## Strategic Ski Trip Planning

When you are aiming to hit both mountains during a mid-winter stay, keep these tips in mind:

*   **Beat the I-93 Traffic:** Because Loon is so accessible, the weekend entry road traffic into Lincoln can back up severely. At Inn 32 in North Woodstock, we are uniquely situated. You can take the "back way" into Loon by hopping on connector roads, completely bypassing the massive highway backup!
*   **Follow the Sun:** Cannon Mountain faces northeast. In the dead of winter, the sun dips behind the massive peak early in the afternoon, plunging the steep slopes into deep, icy shadow. Ski Cannon in the morning to catch the best light and softer snow. Conversely, Loon catches fantastic afternoon sun across many of its wide cruisers. 

## The Perfect Après-Ski Basecamp

After a brutal leg-burning day of navigating icy moguls or ripping long, wide arcs on the groomers, the "après-ski" experience is a critical part of the day. 

North Woodstock is a sleepy, authentic ski town that truly comes alive when the lifts stop spinning. By securing a room at Inn 32, you can literally drop your skis at the door, take a steaming hot shower in our newly renovated walk-in glass showers, and walk down the street to the Woodstock Inn Brewery for a massive plate of nachos and a cold, locally brewed 4000 Footer IPA.

There is no need to worry about the driving conditions—your warm, comfortable bed is just a short walk back down the snowy sidewalk.
